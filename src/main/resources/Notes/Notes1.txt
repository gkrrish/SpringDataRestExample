spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy=ant-path-matcher?

The property spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy is used to configure the strategy used for matching request paths in Spring MVC applications. The default matching strategy is ant-path-matcher, which uses Ant-style path patterns for matching request paths.

Here's how you can configure this property in your Spring Boot application's application.properties or application.yml

@RestController
public class ExampleController {

    @GetMapping("/api/users/{userId}")
    public ResponseEntity<String> getUser(@PathVariable String userId) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok("User ID: " + userId);
    }

    @GetMapping("/api/users/*/orders")
    public ResponseEntity<String> getUserOrders() {
        return ResponseEntity.ok("User orders");
    }
}
In this controller:

The getUser() method handles requests to /api/users/{userId} where {userId} is a dynamic path variable.
The getUserOrders() method handles requests to /api/users/*/orders, where the * represents a wildcard and matches any value between /api/users/ and /orders.
With the ant-path-matcher strategy configured (which is the default in Spring Boot), both of these endpoints will work as expected using Ant-style path patterns.

For example:

A GET request to /api/users/123 will be handled by the getUser() method.
A GET request to /api/users/456/orders will be handled by the getUserOrders() method.
This is just a simple example to demonstrate how you can use Ant-style path patterns with Spring MVC. Depending on your application's requirements, you can use more complex patterns and matchers to handle various types of requests.
